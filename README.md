Shunpo is a minimalist bash tool that tries to make directory navigation in terminal just a little bit faster by providing a simple system to manage bookmarks and jump to directories with only a few keystrokes.
If you frequently need to use commands like `cd`, `pushd`, or `popd`, Shunpo is for you.
